ðŸŽ® About This Project

This project was created as a way to focus my learning in an area I'm genuinely passionate about: game development. 
I wanted to build something practical, visible, and interactive â€” not just to improve my skills, 
but to share my progress with others in a format thatâ€™s easy to access.

I chose to start with a website because it's the most accessible platform
no installs, no downloads â€” just a browser and a computer, and you're in. 
That ease of access makes it perfect for sharing my games as I build them.

ðŸ”§ The Website Foundation

As of writing this, most of the HTML structure is done. 
The site is designed to reflect my growth, so I made sure itâ€™s at least semi-scalable. 
Iâ€™m using JavaScript to automate and streamline a lot of the structure
The game listing page pulls directly from a JSON file, making it easy to add new games without editing a bunch of files.
The game page template is now fully copy-pastable and reusable for each game. I realize there are probably even cleaner or more scalable ways to handle this, 
but for where Iâ€™m at â€” this works, and itâ€™s enough.

ðŸŽµ Some Hiccups

One area I got tripped up on was sound. 
Implementing audio consistently across pages, especially with JavaScript timing and browser limitations, turned out to be more complex than expected. 
Or maybe I'm just not understanding it right.
Itâ€™s something I plan to revisit, but for now Iâ€™ve re-focused on keeping the core structure working and expandable.

ðŸ““ Next Steps & Dev Notes

I'm considering writing this README in a kind of patch notes/dev journal format going forward, 
where each iteration documents what I added, changed, or learned â€” kind of like tracking my own changelog as I go.
This way, anyone reading can not only see the finished project but also follow along with how it was built over time.
